  - Use **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** to manage the organizationâ€™s security posture and protect against threats to their workloads

## Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, solution for both security information and event management (SIEM), and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR). Microsoft Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for attack detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

- Integrate Microsoft Purview with Microsoft Sentinel to gain visibility into where on your network sensitive information is stored, in a way that helps you prioritize at-risk data for protection, and understand the most critical incidents and threats to investigate in Microsoft Sentinel.

- Start by ingesting your Microsoft Purview logs into Microsoft Sentinel through a data source.
Then use a Microsoft Sentinel workbook to view data such as assets scanned, classifications found, and labels applied by Microsoft Purview.
Use analytics rules to create alerts for changes within data sensitivity.
Customize the Microsoft Purview workbook and analytics rules to best suit the needs of your organization, and combine Microsoft Purview logs with data ingested from other sources to create enriched insights within Microsoft Sentinel.
